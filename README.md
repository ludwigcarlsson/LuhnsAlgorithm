# LuhnsAlgorithm
This is a Luhnâ€™s Algorithms console application that starts with asking the user for an input. The program checks the user input so its not empty and only contains numbers. The program validates the input and returns a message letting the user know if it is a valid checksum and also if it is the length of a creditcard. A calculation makes a check digit separated from the other numbers.
There is also 10 different tests included in this application that check the inputs and functionalities in the program.
